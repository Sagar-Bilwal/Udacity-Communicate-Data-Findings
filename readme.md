# Ford GoBike 2019 System Data
## by Sagar Bilwal


## Dataset

> Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Bay Wheels is the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013. On June 28, 2017, the system officially re-launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company. After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was subsequently renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019.

> In this project I am exploring Ford GoBike 2019 data downloaded from https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data


## Summary of Findings

> Summary of findings from exploratory analysis is as follows -

1) March - April and Aug - Oct time period gets increased number of users apart from this the number of user are pretty consistent about 1,80,000 in rest of the year.

2) Weekdays have more users using Ford GoBike than on weekends.

3) During office hours i.e. 7 am to 9 am and 4 pm to 7 pm have increased users while early morning the users are very less.

4) Almost 99.9% of user travel distance less than 4.5 miles using Ford GoBike. 55k user have total distance equal to 0 as the did a round trip using the Ford GoBike.

5) Almost 98% of user travel duration was less than 45 minutes. The median of the total duration for which is Ford GoBike is used is approximately 9.33 min. Most of the user use it between 2.5 min to 15 min.

6) Distribution of traffic in months for subscriber and customer is similar as it first peaks in march and april and then traffic reduces in coming months but again it peaks in August to October time period. 

7) There is some difference in traffic distribution in case of week as subscribers are much more during weekdays than in weekends but customers are almost same ie. around 50k during all days of week. 

8) Again in hour distribution the peaks and decline is similar for both subscriber and customer with traffic peaking 7 am to 9 am and 4 pm to 7 pm.

9) Newbury Park Dr at King Rd has the highest Customer to Subscriber ratio of almost 6.9 which is much higher than other station hence it should be looked into why users of the station do not subscribe.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The goal of this presentation is to analyze user behaviour which includes finding time of day, month or year when Ford GoBike are most in use, average distance and time for which a user uses Ford GoBike. Also through this presentation we can identify stations with highest customer to subscriber ratio which should be low.
